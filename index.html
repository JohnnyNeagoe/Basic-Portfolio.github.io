      <p>Web Developer, Business Startegist, Founder</p>
      <p>Recently received a Full Stack Development certificate from The University of Toronto, where I mastered the art of front end and back end web design. In 2016, I graduated from Wilfrid Laurier University with a Honors Bachelors of Business Administration Degree. In pursuit of my HBBA, I was able to attain valuable skills such as relationship building, business development, strategic analysis and management. I will forever cherish this four year journey, as it has propelled me into becoming the man I am today: an ambitious, courages, intelligent individual who understands the importance of creating long sustaiable relationships.</p>
      <p>I have many years of accounting and finance work experience under my belt, allowing me to understand the importance of implementing a startegic cost structure to a business. These tenures showcased a strong need for cost effective solutions to creating a state of the art website/application in the pursuit of attracting new clients. My current skillset enables me to deliver up-to-date web development support at an industry leading price. Choose Spillor as your web provider today!</p>
